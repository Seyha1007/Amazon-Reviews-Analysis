Welcome to the **Amazon Reviews Analysis** repository! This project dives into the world of Amazon Fine Food Reviews to explore the emotional intensity and lexical repetition of negative reviews compared to positive ones. By leveraging R programming, we conduct sentiment analysis and assess lexical diversity to reveal patterns in consumer review language.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to answer a fundamental question: Are negative reviews more emotionally intense and lexically repetitive than positive reviews? By analyzing a dataset of Amazon Fine Food Reviews, we apply various statistical methods and visualizations to uncover insights that can help businesses and consumers understand the dynamics of online reviews.

### Objectives

- Analyze the emotional tone of reviews using sentiment analysis.
- Measure lexical diversity using metrics like Type-Token Ratio (TTR).
- Visualize the findings to make them accessible and understandable.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate the emotional tone of reviews.
- **Lexical Diversity Metrics**: Analyze the variety of language used in reviews.
- **Data Visualization**: Create clear and informative graphics using ggplot2.
- **Statistical Testing**: Apply hypothesis testing to validate findings.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project comes from the Amazon Fine Food Reviews, which contains reviews, ratings, and other metadata about food products. This rich dataset provides ample opportunity for analysis.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seyha1007/Amazon-Reviews-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have R and RStudio installed. Then, install the necessary packages by running:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "stringr", "textdata"))
   ```

3. **Download the Data**:
   You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/Seyha1007/Amazon-Reviews-Analysis/releases). Download the required files and execute them in RStudio.

## Usage

Once you have the project set up, you can start analyzing the reviews. Open the main R script in RStudio and run the following commands:

1. Load the necessary libraries:
   ```R
   library(tidyverse)
   library(ggplot2)
   ```

2. Load the dataset:
   ```R
   reviews <- read.csv("path/to/your/data.csv")
   ```

3. Start your analysis by executing the provided functions in the script.

## Analysis Techniques

### Sentiment Analysis

We use various sentiment analysis techniques to gauge the emotional tone of reviews. This involves:

- **Lexicon-based approaches**: Using predefined dictionaries to score the sentiment of words.
- **Machine Learning**: Training models to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Lexical Diversity Metrics

To measure how varied the language is in reviews, we calculate:

- **Type-Token Ratio (TTR)**: This metric compares the number of unique words (types) to the total number of words (tokens) in a review.
- **Diversity Index**: A more complex measure that accounts for the frequency of word usage.

### Data Visualization

Using `ggplot2`, we create visual representations of our findings. This helps in understanding trends and patterns in the data.

## Results

The analysis reveals significant differences between positive and negative reviews. Negative reviews tend to be more emotionally intense and lexically repetitive. Our visualizations clearly illustrate these trends, making it easier to comprehend the findings.
